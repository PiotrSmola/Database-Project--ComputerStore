# JSDoc Documentation for TechByte

Welcome to the JSDoc documentation for TechByte, where we maintain comprehensive and detailed documentation for the JavaScript codebase of our cutting-edge computer retail platform.

## Overview

JSDoc is a popular documentation generator for JavaScript. We use it to create an elegant and searchable collection of documentation pages from inline comments in the code. This ensures that developers can easily understand the structure, functionalities, and usage of the codebase.

## Guidelines for JSDoc Comments

- All JavaScript functions, classes, methods, and properties should be documented with JSDoc comments.
- Comments should clearly describe the purpose of the code and any parameters or return values.
- Use JSDoc tags (e.g., `@param`, `@return`) to provide additional detail and structure.
- Keep comments up-to-date with any changes in the code to ensure consistency.

## Building the Documentation

To generate the documentation:

1. Ensure that you have JSDoc installed globally or in your project's `node_modules`.
2. Run the JSDoc command in the root directory of the project:
```
jsdoc -c jsdoc.json
```
3. The generated HTML documentation will be placed in the `out/` directory (or another specified output directory).

## Accessing the Documentation

The latest version of the documentation can be accessed by opening the `index.html` file in the generated `out/` directory in any web browser.

Alternatively, for a live development environment, documentation can be served using a local server, and it will be regenerated on changes to the source code.

## Contributing to the Documentation

To contribute to the documentation:

- Clone the repository and create a new branch for your documentation updates.
- Write your JSDoc comments in the source code.
- Generate the documentation to ensure your comments yield the expected output.
- Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.

For more detailed guidelines, please refer to the project's `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

## Maintainers

The documentation is maintained by the TechByte development team. If you encounter any issues or require assistance, please open an issue in the project's GitHub repository.
